# Project Overview

## üîß Project Structure

This project follows a clean and modular architecture using several design patterns and best practices:

- **Service Locator Pattern** ‚Äì Centralized access to game-wide services.
- **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** ‚Äì Clean separation of game logic, UI, and data.
- **Observer Pattern** ‚Äì Event-based communication between systems.
- **Singleton Pattern** ‚Äì Ensures a single instance for critical managers.

All scripts communicate through a central `GameService`, promoting loose coupling and maintainability.

## üéØ Quest System Design

The quest system is built to be **scalable**, **modular**, and **extensible** using **ScriptableObjects**:

- A **base ScriptableObject class** (`QuestSO`) defines the core structure and methods for quests.
- Each specific quest inherits from this base and overrides relevant methods to define custom behavior.
- This design allows easy addition of new quests without modifying existing code, supporting flexibility and reusability.

## ‚ú® Additional Features

- **Shooting System**: Implemented using **Raycasting** to simulate bullets and hit detection.
- **Particle Effects**: Integrated with the shooting mechanic to enhance visual feedback.
- **Clean Separation of Concerns**: Each system is independently designed for easy testing and scalability.
